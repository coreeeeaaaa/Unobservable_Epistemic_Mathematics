# Flow structure for unobservable epistemic mathematics

P2 Flow preservation theorems with semigroup and measure-preserving properties.

## Main Results

- `Flow`: A parameterized family of measure-preserving transformations
- `flow_semigroup`: Semigroup property φ(s+t) = φ(s) ∘ φ(t)
- `flow_measurable`: Each time-slice φ(t) is measurable
- `flow_measure_preserving`: Each transformation preserves the measure
