| Lemma | Namespace | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `measure_add_measure_compl` | `MeasureTheory` | Splits `μ Set.univ` into contributions from a measurable set and its complement (residual positivity). |
| `lt_of_le_of_ne` | `LE` (core) | Convert `≤` plus inequality to strict positivity for measures. |
| `lintegral_mono_ae` | `MeasureTheory` | Integrates pointwise lower bounds to obtain the kernel integral inequality. |
| `lintegral_const` | `MeasureTheory` | Evaluates the integral of a constant function (`τ_min * μ Set.univ`). |
| `Filter.Eventually.of_forall` | `Filter` | Lifts a pointwise bound into an almost-everywhere statement for integrals. |
