## Technical Implementation Details

### Counterfactual Definition
```lean
def Counterfactual (ε : ℝ≥0∞) (Π : Measure α) (Π' : Measure α) : Prop :=
  (∀ A : Set α, MeasurableSet A → |Π A - Π' A| ≤ ε) ∧
  (∀ F : Set α, IsClosed F → Π' F ≤ Π F + ε) ∧
  (∀ G : Set α, IsOpen G → Π G ≤ Π' G + ε)
```

### Key Mathematical Properties
- **Measure distance**: Total variation bound ε
- **Portmanteau conditions**: Closed/open set bounds
- **Weak convergence**: Dominated convergence compatibility
